# Final Project Ideas for New Maps Plus MS
#### Lauren Oldham, January 2020

Guideline:
```
I want to design a map that X

because I want to find out who/what/when/where/whether/why/how _________,

in order to help the map user or audience understand better ____________.
```
## 1. College Basketball Domination
I want to design a map that explores the trends in college basketball domination because I want to find out where the most powerful teams exist in order to help the audience have arguments about which team is the best. ;)
 
Building on my [final project for MAP-675](https://laurenoldham1202.github.io/ncaam-basketball/), I'd like to build a 
comprehensive web application that explores all 350 Division I college basketball programs in the United States. Whereas 
my 675 map only included schools that were in the top 50 winningest programs or had at least one National Championship 
title, I would like to include every D1 school with various filtering options to display the data.

### Goal
Have fun! I love college basketball and really like the idea of doing something personally enjoyable (and seasonably appropriate!) for my final project.
There is always a lot of discussion (ahem, argument) about who has the greatest program, the greatest conference, etc. so it would be great to provide a definitive source for all things CBB.
Maps are [wildly popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/search?q=map&restrict_sr=on) over at [/r/CollegeBasketball](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/), so I'm inspired to do something bigger and better than what currently exists.
My target audience includes /r/CollegeBasketball users, friends, coworkers, family, casual sports fans and fanatics alike.

### Outline/Notes
* Include data for all D1 schools
* Make table collapsible
* Make table filterable
* Make table sortable
* Style table row on click to semitransparent school color
* Update table ranking with each selected field
* Add school filtering options, e.g. display by conference, only top 50 winningest teams, only top win percentages, etc. 
* Add school logo image to popup
* Bonus: Add March Madness appearances, number of lottery picks, etc.

### Limitations/Issues
* This dataset doesn't exist! Might need to explore web scraping to avoid painful manual collection of all these datasets
* Break classes had to be manually created to create enough visual distinction between schools

### Datasets
* [Historical college basketball statistics](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/)
* [National Championship titles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament)
* [Top 50 overall winningest teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_teams_with_the_most_victories_in_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_college_basketball)
* [Top 50 winning percentage teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_teams_with_the_highest_winning_percentage_in_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_college_basketball)
* [Team colors 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module:College_color)
* [Team colors 2](https://teamcolorcodes.com/ncaa-color-codes/)
* [Team colors 3](https://usteamcolors.com/ncaa-division-1/)

## 2. March Madness Top Seed Sites Analysis
#### I want to design a map that analyzes and visualizes the tournament sites for top seeds in March Madness because I want to find out whether top teams are given geographical preference (as the seeding rules claim).

Tackling college basketball from a different approach, I'd like to explore the NCAA committee claim that top seeds in 
the tournament will play their first two games at sites "most geographically compatible to those teams." 
In short, the best teams of the year play closer to their fan base, which can give them home court advantage in the most 
upset-prone rounds of the tournament. While many factors go into assigning teams to different sites, it's always a 
contentious issue for fans - every fan base claims that they get screwed by the selection committee, whereas <opposing 
team I hate> gets preferential treatment! 

### Goal
Find out if any particular top teams are consistently given preferential locations over other top teams. It's a question
that I would like answered as a fan of college basketball. Everyone loves to have proof during CBB turf war!

### Outline/Notes
* Should probably limit data to modern March Madness seeding rules, beginning in 1985
* Maybe use some sort of animation to signify distances between home base and tourney sites

TBD

### Limitations/Issues
* Data will need to be manually collected
* Not sure if there are any correlations - could be a lot of work with no significant results or visualizations
* The US is big! Most dominant teams are in the midwest/south/eastern, so the few dominant teams in the west often have 
to travel farther than eastern teams
* Not sure how I would visualize the data
* May need to brush up on some basic statistics

### Datasets
Seeding history is often found on team wikipedia pages.

## Other Potential Ideas
I have a few other vague topics of interest that could be used to make a nice map, so I'm open to any ideas or suggestions from the list below!

### Homelessness in America/Anti-Homeless Legislation
I don't have as much base knowledge for this topic, but I hear about it in the news increasingly often. 
While homelessness is not explicitly outlawed, many pieces of (controversial) legislation have been enacted in the 
United States to curb the visibility of homelessness in cities. I think that the biggest hurdle would be finding 
complete, reliable, and updated data. I would love input on a more specific topic and/or interesting datasets to combine!
