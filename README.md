## 1. College Basketball Domination
#### I want to design a map that explores the trends in college basketball domination because I want to find out where the most powerful teams exist in order to help the audience have arguments about which team is the best. ;)
 
Building on my [final project for MAP-675](https://laurenoldham1202.github.io/ncaam-basketball/), I'd like to build a 
comprehensive web application that explores all 350 Division I college basketball programs in the United States. Whereas 
my 675 map only included schools that were in the top 50 winningest programs or had at least one National Championship 
title, I would like to include every D1 school with various filtering options to display the data.

### Goal
Have fun! I love college basketball and really like the idea of doing something personally enjoyable (and seasonably appropriate!) for my final project.
There is always a lot of discussion (ahem, argument) about who has the greatest program, the greatest conference, etc. so it would be great to provide a definitive source for all things CBB.
Maps are wildly popular over at [/r/CollegeBasketball](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/search?q=map&restrict_sr=on), so I'm inspired to do something bigger and better than what currently exists.
My target audience includes /r/CollegeBasketball users, friends, coworkers, family, casual sports fans and fanatics alike.

### Outline
* Include data for all D1 schools
* Make table collapsible
* Make table filterable
* Make table sortable
* Style table row on click to semitransparent school color
* Update table ranking with each selected field
* Add school filtering options, e.g. display by conference, only top 50 winningest teams, only top win percentages, etc. 
* Add school logo image to popup
* Bonus: Add March Madness appearances, number of lottery picks, etc.

### Limitations/Issues
* This dataset doesn't exist! Might need to explore web scraping to avoid painful manual collection of all these datasets
* Break classes had to be manually created to create enough visual distinction between schools

### Datasets
* [Historical college basketball statistics](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/)
* [National Championship titles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament)
* [Top 50 overall winningest teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_teams_with_the_most_victories_in_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_college_basketball)
* [Top 50 winning percentage teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_teams_with_the_highest_winning_percentage_in_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_college_basketball)
* [Team colors 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module:College_color)
* [Team colors 2](https://teamcolorcodes.com/ncaa-color-codes/)
* [Team colors 3](https://usteamcolors.com/ncaa-division-1/)
